## 📑 Overview

This project leverages **PhoBERT** with the **UIT-VSFC** dataset to classify sentiment in Vietnamese text. By utilizing the power of a transformer-based model fine-tuned for Vietnamese, this project achieves highly accurate sentiment predictions, ideal for natural language understanding applications in Vietnamese.

## ✨ Key Features

- **State-of-the-Art NLP**: Employs PhoBERT, a leading model for Vietnamese language understanding.
- **UIT-VSFC Dataset**: Trained on a well-curated dataset with extensive Vietnamese sentiment data.
- **Robust Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral with precision.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeHuyHongNhat/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-PhoBERT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-Using-PhoBERT
   ```
## 📝 Usage

### Data Preparation

Download the **UIT-VSFC** dataset in .

### Model Training

Fine-tune PhoBERT on the UIT-VSFC dataset

### Evaluation

Evaluate model performance on the test dataset

## 📊 Results

The fine-tuned model achieves high accuracy on the UIT-VSFC dataset, demonstrating effectiveness for sentiment analysis tasks in Vietnamese. Detailed metrics can be found in the `notebooks`.
## 🚀 Future Work

- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporate additional Vietnamese sentiment datasets.
- **Multi-Label Sentiment**: Extend the model to capture more nuanced sentiment variations.
